At: <a href="../www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp@filename=tryhtml_basic_img" target="_blank">w3schools HTML Basic-4 Examples--Images </a>, I noticed that the image appears to be square but the width is 104 and the height is 142. Is there a difference in size of the units or is it that they are displayed differently so the end result makes the image square?<br /><br />The info doesn't say at this point if the diminsions are pixels. Are they in pixels?<br /><br />Thanks.<BR>

<A HREF="index.php@showtopic=36151">Group of words at the bottom of a Web Page</A><BR>
Hello, my name is David, I'm new to this forum and all forums for that matter. Anyways I have a question I hope someone can clear up for me. <br /><br />I've noticed on a couple web pages I've visited there is this big list of words and phrases all in a group at the bottom of the page. They look like keywords. What is this list of words/phrase's all about?<br /><br />I have an idea of what they are. I have heard that search engine's don't like it when you use keywords that are not within the content of your page. I'm thinking maybe they use this big group of words/phrase's so they can list keywords in there meta tag's  that maybe have a higher CPC percentage, or lower competition. And the search engine's wont penalize them for it, kind of like a loop-hole. I could be way off base since I really have no clue.<br /><br />If anyone knows the answer, I'd very much like to know. thanks a lot!<BR>

I'm excited to announce that my project is finally online...no, it isn't officially launched yet, but I want you guys to be the first ones to test it. The address is <i>cyberstream dot us</i>. I am intentionally not linking to it because I don't want robots to find it yet. <br /><br />Everything on the website right now is dummy data, so feel free to post test comments, etc. I will truncate all of the tables immediately before the website is launched (besides the table that contains users). Ignore the watermarks and website logos. They were for previous ideas I had, and I haven't created a new logo yet. If you see the text 'arcticimaging' or 'cyberstream.<b>com</b>', please let me know. I think I replaced all of those with the current website name, but I may have missed some. Any other comments regarding security, functionality or presentation are welcome.  <br /><br />Thanks!<BR>

I'm new to developing web apps for mobile devices.

<A HREF="index.php@showtopic=36110">Tutorial on ADODB (PHP Database Manipulation Library)</A><BR>
For people who do not know about ADODB:<br /><b>ADODB is an object orientated database manipulation library for PHP, compatible with all major database server types, where you do not need to remember some functions for MySQL and others for Oracle, and you can make your scripts compatible with any database system.</b><br /><br />This PHP script:<br /><br /><!--c1--><div class='codetop'>CODE</div><div class='codemain'><!--ec1-->&#60;?php<br /><br />$con=mysql_connect&#40;'localhost', 'user', 'pass'&#41;;<br />mysql_select_db&#40;'mydb', $con&#41;;<br />mysql_query&#40;'SELECT * FROM mytable'&#41;;<br /><br />$con2=mssql_connect&#40;'localhost', 'user', 'pass'&#41;;<br />mssql_select_db&#40;'mydb', $con&#41;;<br />mssql_query&#40;'SELECT * FROM mytable'&#41;;<br /><br />?&#62;<!--c2--></div><!--ec2--><br /><br />is exactly equal to this ADODB 5 script:<br /><br /><!--c1--><div class='codetop'>CODE</div><div class='codemain'><!--ec1-->&#60;?php<br /><br />include &#40;'adodb5/adodb.inc.php'&#41;;<br /><br />$db=ADONewConnection&#40;'mysql'&#41;;<br />$db-&#62;Connect&#40;'localhost', 'user', 'pass', 'mydb'&#41;;<br />$db-&#62;Execute&#40;'SELECT * FROM mytable'&#41;;<br /><br />$db2=ADONewConnection&#40;'mssql'&#41;;<br />$db2-&#62;Connect&#40;'localhost', 'user', 'pass', 'mydb'&#41;;<br />$db2-&#62;Execute&#40;'SELECT * FROM mytable'&#41;;<br /><br />?&#62;<!--c2--></div><!--ec2--><br /><br />As you can see, in the first script, you need to change the entire code, however in the second it is enough to change the database type of the ADODB object, which you can store in a remote config file.<br /><br />Now many sites use ADODB 5 for compability with other database systems and also for the ability to execute queries on different databases without destroying the connection and reconnecting.<br /><br />I think a tutorial about this on W3Schools would be of great use.<BR>

<A HREF="index.php@showtopic=36050">Passing data from browser to server?</A><BR>
Hello, <br /><br />Apologies if this is the wrong place, is common knowledge or just a stupid question.<br /><br />As part of a project I'm working on, I need to find a way to pass data from the browser back to the server. Specifically, I'm trying to find a way for the browser to confirm that it has received an image so that the server can then delete it.<br /><br />So far I've used a PHP script to copy a specific image and CSS file from a protected folder into the unprotected folder, renaming it to match the users IP and then to delete it after a two second interval. In most cases, where the internet connection is fast enough, this allows users to view the image but when they try to backtrack to the CSS file or the image they'll find it's not there. In addition to this, there will be the usual "image protection" tricks such as placing an empty repeating .gif file over the top and disabling right click etc. <br /><br />In general this works pretty easily. I use three browsers to test my code regularly, and each has a different way of downloading the picture. Google Chrome is by far the easiest to deal with. It doesn't seem to cache the CSS file, and the lack of "save background image" feature means that most users won't be able to get said image. Firefox does cache the CSS, so when you look at the source code and click on the CSS file, it'll end up showing the path to the image. Once you click on that though, the user just gets pointed to a 404 because the image isn't there. Whereas IE is the only browser that lets you "save background" image, which is where the disable right click comes in.<br /><br />The issue with this is that if the internet connection is slow, or the browser is slow, the image gets deleted before the browser is able to retrieve it. In addition to this the two second interval stops parts of the page from being rendered until the image is delete. I've tried to get around that by using ob_flush and instead of the sleep function I've tried doing a loop which only executes the delete function after two seconds by comparing start time to current time. Neither really solve the problem though.<br /><br />So, with that in mind, is there any way of passing a variable from something like a Javascript back to PHP? I know this can present a bit a of security problem because it could potentially allow people to execute a PHP script directly from their browser, so if possible I'd like to avoid that too. <br /><br />Is Java even the way to go with this?<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any help, tips or suggestions.<br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br />Takuhi<BR>

I have learn HTML,XHTML, and CSS including some basic tutorial MySQL, I did have learned, but one thing I try to learn on the function.  Actually what I try to learn is how you can get automatically value in the row of the table of MySQL. Let say you create a table call Quote list, the column (from,to,mileage,price) let say you insert some value in the from=IL, to=CA,mileage=1000, and then you get the value automatically in the price=??, how we can put some function to be read from mileage&lt;1000, how we can put some value from other table you create the price list. I know how to do with the Microsoft Exel. Do you have any idea, recommendation for me or you can offer me a book how to learn more with function of MySQl or somthing else. if you can't understand please let me know, i can try explain more details what i want actually.

Up to now, I have been using 1 CSS file, namely "stylesheet.css". Now that the past few days I have been all over the internet studying navigation menus, seeing that some menus can be long (images and other codes). I am wondering what you guys tend to do? Stay with 1 CSS file and use all the menu and everything within it OR 2 CSS files with 1 being menu.css and other being stylesheet.css (or what other names you use?)?<br /><br />Along with above question, to use 2 CSS files in one HTML page, I would have to use "@import" or can still use below in that order:<br />&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="menu.css" type="text/css" /&gt;<br />&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css" type="text/css" /&gt;<br /><br />Also, XHTML requires lower case HTML name? Like "index.html" instead of "Index.html" ??<br /><br />Correct me... even if I use all lower case for HTML names, others still can use caps to get to my website? Like one types "www.LazyFoxJumps.com" will open with registered "www.lazyfoxjumps.com" ?<br /><br />Chuck<BR>

I really like your site and it has been very helpful for me. But there are a few things that I feel could be added. The first might be an assignment or two that goes along with each section. Like perhaps at the end of the html section create a website that utilizes x, y, z... It might be a nice way to add perspective to the material.  <br /><br />Sometimes as a noob reading this, its difficult to imagine when a certain bit of code is used for example is it a better practice in blank situation to use the &lt;div&gt; or &lt;table&gt; element. So maybe  a screen shot of a professional webpage that utilizes this element, how and then some notes on best practices. Perhaps an example of a professional site and a break down of how it was executed. I feel something like that would really help me see the forest for the trees. I appreciate your site, thanks for making html and css much easier for me.<BR>

I've recently returned to web design after a 10 year break - a lot has changed.<br /><br />I've spent the last few weeks learning CSS, some very basic javascript and php and also brushing up on my HTML markup.<br /><br />The one thing that eludes me slightly, are what the best practices are these days for ever-present navigation menus that sit on top of every single page in a website.<br /><br />Naturally no one uses frames anymore, and from what I read iframes aren't so great either - recently I've had a go at automatically creating navigation menus on every page using PHP server side includes and similarly with javascript document.write scripts - both worked perfectly well (and when I wanted to edit the navigation menu for every page - I only had to make the chance once), but it's suggested that both methods would be considered very bad practice.<br /><br />So I guess the question is, what exactly do people do nowadays?<br /><br /><br />Also as a side question - is it still safe to use tables when you need to actually display tabular data? I understand that their use may now be deprecated - (and using tables for layout purposes was never a good idea) but is it ok to use them without fear they're going to suddenly be dropped?<br /><br /><BR>

When browsing the internet for research on HTML5 and CSS3 I struggled to find any clear CSS3 gradient tutorials, and I was disappointed not to be able to find anything on W3Schools. I hope that an article could be added soon outlining how to do it in all the major browsers as there are differences.<BR>

<A HREF="index.php@showtopic=35748">Web Applications - Help me plan out on what to learn</A><BR>
Hi I am new to web development and is very keen on learning and to eventually develop web applications.<br /><br />Particularly I want to develop web apps on the Google Chrome platform.<br /><br />Now I know bits and pieces but I am having a hard time prioritising what to learn because I have limited understanding on how it all fits together.  So I am having issues understanding the big picture.<br /><br />Now I have a web host setup and my plan atm is to learn some languages while slowly building something for fun to compliment my meticulous study of e-books.  Right now I plan to learn the following:<br /><br />some time on HTML/XHTML, CSS<br />Javascript<br />PHP<br />mySQL<br /><br />But I don't how these fit together, I don't know what is more important and I sure don't know what to do from here to develop web apps.  I just need some direction and background on this for a noobie.<br /><br />Thanks guys, go easy on me.  Look forward to this discussion<br /><BR>

<A HREF="index.php@showtopic=35727">HTML 5 and CSS 3</A><BR>
I know some browser have support for these, but I don't have a strong statistic on these per browser or anything.<br /><br />What I'm wondering is when would it be suitable to start developing in these. You see, not only am I a developer myself, but there is a class at a local high school that relies on information from me, and I'm wondering when I should start updating the curriculum to include HTML 5 and CSS 3 standards. As it stands, the curriculum teaches using the XHTML 1.0 and CSS 2 standards.<br /><br />Also, it'd be a nice thing for me to know, so I can be up to date in my own work.<BR>

<A HREF="index.php@showtopic=35693">XML Tutorial</A><BR>
In your XML documentation you never specify the format of the &lt;?xml ... ?&gt; line. You give some examples, but never specifications. The tutorial frequently recommends saving the file in UTF-8 format, but every example of the encoding attribute shows encoding="ISO-8859-1". I can only guess that what I want is &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?&gt; .<br /><br />Also, it is not clear from your write-up whether single quotes (') are legal as xml quotes, or only double quotes (") are legal. In many languages we use double quotes to surround the entire output string and so single quotes are easier to use inside the string. For exampoe, this PHP statement:<br /><div class='codetop'>CODE</div><div class='codemain' style='height:200px;white-space:pre;overflow:auto'>    echo "&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8' ?&gt;&#092;n";</div><br />creates an &lt;?xml ... ?&gt; line with apostrophes rather than double quotes. Is this legal XML?<br /><br />Suggestion for improvement: cover the &lt;?xml ... ?&gt; specifications, change your examples to UTF-8, and clarify single versus double quotes.<br /><BR>

<A HREF="index.php@showtopic=35669">Web Development Blogs</A><BR>
Recently, I've become much more interested in coding conventions, online tools and resources, and other various ways to improve my web work. While W3Schools is a fantastic place to learn, and W3C has everything you "need" to know, neither of these are a one-stop-shop for all of your coding needs.<br /><br />For this reason, I figured I would not only ask for some user-contributed web design and development blogs, but keep a solid, compiled version of it here for anyone who wants to reference it. I will certainly be putting most, if not all, blogs straight into Google Reader though. :] I'll start the list below with the two that I already follow. I'd be very much interested if someone can point me in the direction of a blog that talks about web developing best practices and techniques!<br /><br /><a href="../www.webmonkey.com/default.htm" target="_blank">http://www.webmonkey.com/</a><br />A blog which talks about everything from browser development to new libraries and frameworks for web coding and scripting languages you know and love.<br /><br /><a href="../www.webdevcat.com/default.htm" target="_blank">http://www.webdevcat.com/</a><br />More centered on blog customization and theming, but there are lots of good tools mentioned throughout this blog.

Sort of an all-in-one.<br /><br /><a href="../net.tutsplus.com/default.htm" target="_blank">http://net.tutsplus.com/</a><br />Another all-in-one here, though it seems to focus almost entirely on web development, not so much design.<br /><br /><a href="../tutorialzine.com/default.htm" target="_blank">http://tutorialzine.com/</a><br />As the URL would imply, all about tutorials and implementation examples here.

Well, what i just recently came across was this, I originally was using the same template for the header and footer for all of the pages on my site "<a href="../hightoleranceband.com/default.htm" target="_blank">here</a>" and i recently came to an epiphany that instead of having the same images saved for each page on each pages directory i can simply link them to the main domain image folder with the "/images/xxx.jpg". Is this a good idea or i should i have a set of images in each directory of the site to load faster. (i may be using the pages directory or sub directory or sub domain names incorrectly, if i am please advise!)<br /><br />Also, what about style sheets. Right now i have pretty much the same exact style sheet linked in each subdomain. should i link them the same way like the head and footer images to the same one in the main directory?<br /><br />Thirdly, since i been involved in web design i have been somewhat graphicly involved... Now this leaves me with what is the best format for images, Just regular images as JPG's? what about if you need a transparent background PNG's?<br /><br />PS i know my gallery is not centered in IE right now it is being addressed in a different post in the appropriate topic.<BR>

<A HREF="index.php@showtopic=35410">W3Schools has some damage to answer for</A><BR>
Hi folks, <br /><br />  Good of you to provide this section of the forum, but looking down the list I didn't see much actual criticism. <br /><br />  First off let me say that to the extent that you have provide some people with useful information you are to be congratulated, I know it's a big job. But having said that I have to tell you that the reason I joined as a member was to yell at you for some of the worst documentation I've seen in a long time -- and yell at you even louder for making CSS so very much harder to use and learn than it ever needed to be.  I'm guessing that you have put the uptake of CSS as a standard back by several years. <br /><br />  To provide some credibility for my accusations I should tell you that I've been in I.T. for more than 30 years and I began my career in technical documentation at Zilog in Silicon Valley - prior to that I was a student at the University of California (Santa Cruz) where I worked on the campus newspaper. <br /><br />  The documentation failures I've seen on the W3Schools site (and there are many) can be summed up by this little gem: <br /><br />  <img src="../www.hazen.co.nz/14_css1/images/W3example.png" border="0" class="linked-image" /><br /><br />  from: <a href="../www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_standardattributes.asp" target="_blank">http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_standardattributes.asp</a> <br /><br />  and I'd like to ask if there is anyone still on your staff that wants to justify this as "documentation" ? <br /><br />  If there is, please fire them as this is not documentation it's just repetition and your web pages are full of it.<br /><br /> My second accusation is that you have perpetuated the belief that CSS is hard, complicated, and very difficult to learn - and indeed it is the way you and many others in the field present it.  I have spent far too many hours searching  for intelligent material to help me get to term with CSS and in all but the most recent case, threw up my hands in frustration and disgust at the impenetrability of the material. <br /><br />  Finally, on my own, I can to an understanding of CSS that now allows me to manipulate my web pages with a bit of confidence. You are welcome to read my story here:  <a href="../www.hazen.co.nz/14_css1/14_index.html" target="_blank">http://www.hazen.co.nz/14_css1/14_index.html</a> <br /><br />  Sorry for being so harsh, I'm sure I'll regret it later, this is many hours of needlessly wasted hours coming through. <br /><br />  To end on a lighter note -  I did offer some useful statistics that you provided on what screen resolutions people are using now. <br /><br />  I look forward to some much improved documentation in the future, <br /><br />                      - Deck<BR>

I have a few questions.. and would really appreciate some advice. I would really like to get into Web Design. I have already went through college and got a BFA in Photography and Graphic Design. Unfortunetly, they didn't teach us a thing on Web Design. After my experience I have decided I do not want to go back to school if I can possibly teach myself the things I need to know online and maybe get certified. Is this a bad idea on my part, would I be better off going and trying to get a tech diploma from a local school? (My ultimate goal is to get a job as a web designer in the future). <br /><br />Also, I have come to understand(from various posts) that the best first step is to learn HTML. I am in the process of doing this. Although, I cannot help but get sidetracked by the fact that there is XHTML, HTML 4.0, HTML 5 that I have heard of. So what is it that W3Schools is using for the tutorial? Then there are depreciated tags.. which I understand the issue, and thats just part of tech. But here is my question.. on top of the HTML variences, there is CSS(ya I know, style) but then there is Dreamweaver, ect. that comes in to play & then JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX, and countless other 'things' that I am not even sure of what they are. It all gets a little distracting. I feel like I am getting way ahead ofmyself trying to dive into HTML if I don't really know how any of these other languages ect. play into eachother. Is there any website, book, explaination or advice someone could give me to caregorize these and let me know how they all work with eachother and what there rolls are. Just a basic overview..? <br /><br />Thanks in advance<br />-Steph<br /> <br /><BR>

So I the other day I had a good idea for a website that I would like to try to make a reality in my spare time.  Problem is, I have no clue how to create a website.  I am an electrical engineer, and have done a decent amount of coding in assembly, Visual Basic, C and C++, so I would think I could pick up the coding aspect relatively quickly.  What I am hoping to get is some direction on where to focus my efforts and how different tools come together.<br /><br />The site I have in mind (hope this doesn't just turn into a pipe dream) will ultimately have user accounts, incorporate google maps to show locations, have the ability for users to upload/download thier own files, etc.  Given what I have in mind, it would be awesome if I could get some input on what I should be looking to learn.  This site looks like a great resource, but does anyone have suggestions for a good book that might help me out with where I am trying to go?<br /><br />Thanks in advance!!!<BR>

Not quit sure where to post this and there doesn't appear to be any contact information on the W3Schools main site...<br /><br />Anyhow, I think there is an error in one of the <a href="../www.w3schools.com/html5/html5_canvas.asp" target="_blank">canvas example </a> where an image is being dawn onto a canvas (<a href="../www.w3schools.com/html5/tryit.asp@filename=tryhtml5_canvas_image" target="_blank">link</a>).<br /><br />If you are already on the page with the list of examples, you may notice that the last example actually shows up as a blank canvas but when you go into the actual example the image shows up.  From here, if you got back to the previous page (Back button, Alt + left arrow, whichever...) then the image would show up.<br /><br />Moreover, I tried copying the code (and the image, of course) onto my machine and then run it - nothing.  After fiddling around a little and Googling for a bit there seems to be a pre-loading problem with the example on W3Schools.<br /><br />One solution I have found so far is to add, after the lines:<br /><br /><i>var img = new Image();<br />img.src = "img_flwr.png"</i><br /><br />The lines:<br /><br /><i>img.onload = function()<br />{<br />    context.drawImage(img, 0, 0);<br />}</i><br /><br /><br /><br />Apologies in advance if I made a mistake - beginner here.  <img src="style_emoticons/default/smile.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid=":)" border="0" alt="smile.gif" /><br /><br />Oh, also, because of that an animation example that I was working on didn't quite work out for me - feel free to drop a hint or two.  <img src="style_emoticons/default/tongue.gif" style="vertical-align:middle" emoid=":P" border="0" alt="tongue.gif" /><BR>

This is regarding the reference page...<br /><a href="../www.w3schools.com/jsref/default.asp" target="_blank">http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/default.asp</a><br /><br />I suggest you put the word "statement" on this page somewhere.  As a newbie, I don't know if statements are a part of JS or not, but in either case the topic should appear on the main reference page.  After all this is a school, right?  If you want to refer visitors to another page, that's great, but please say something.  My understanding is that the following are statements, but it is impossible to tell from the reference pages...<br /><br />counter.number.value<br />document.write<br />document.layers.cust.document.write<br />window.alert<br />window.location<br /><br />Makes it really frustrating for newcomers.

Hi!<br /><br />Normally I'm not a fan of the grammar correction post, but I thought I'd point this one out. I can't decide whether it's supposed to be funny or if it's a genuine mistake!<br /><br />On the <a href="../www.w3schools.com/html5/html5_ref_standardattributes.asp" target="_blank">HTML 5 Standard Attributes</a> page, there's a mistake in the description of the "spellcheck" attribute. The description reads, "Specifies if the element must have it's spelling and grammar checked".<br /><br />Of course, this <i>should</i> read, "Specifies if the element must have <b>its</b> spelling and grammar checked". (No apostrophe, because "its" is possessive here, not a contraction of "it is".)<br /><br />You can see why I might have thought this was supposed to be a joke.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful,<br /><br />JT.<BR>

<A HREF="index.php@showtopic=34812">I need a.. counselor? I guess you'd say</A><BR>
Hello all,<br />  I realize this forum is the general discussion forum for w3schools.com (Great site, btw) so I apologize if this is the inappropriate place, but I have a simple request/question.<br /><br />I haven't done any real web scripting/design in almost 8 years, if I had to guess.<br />I originally worked with a lot of HTML, PHP, MySQL, a little perl. No wysiwyg editors. <br /><br />I have to projects I need to work on. I would like to emphasize, heavily, I do not want anyone writing anything for me. I want to get back into design myself, learning it myself, doing it myself. My linux/unix LAMP server management skillset has not atrophied, but unfortunately the web page design and deployment side has... almost completely. Can't even get my old web site running correctly anymore (though I have a general idea, that's another story).<br /><br />The projects.<br /><br />One is for my folks. They need help with something, and I need to create a page that lets them enter in numbers that I'll store on a rig I have in their house (no internet access, just lan) and they can pull the numbers back up at any time. I believe they want a method of keeping track of their expenses on their computer, and I have a lot of ideas on a simple page that I could write to do this. This seems relatively easy, and I know I could do it with my prehistorical html, php and mysql knowledge, however I would like to breach the 21st century. I feel like there's probably better, or more options for designing it than I am currently aware of.<br /><br />Second is a character builder for a game called "Exalted" my coworkers and I play. Yes, it's nerdy, I apologize. There are a few out there but none of them do what I need to do. Ideally, I'd like to build it to be something like the character builder used here <a href="../www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/edit-build" target="_blank">http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/edit-build</a> but I have no interest in stealing their code or even their methodology. My real problem is, when I view their code, I can't even figure out what I'm looking at. I believe it's a blend of javascript and css, but I feel like I'm missing something.<br /><br />Essentially, what I would really appreciate, is someone to give me an idea of what I should study in order to accomplish these two goals.<br />I know I should run through some HTML/PHP refreshers, but what else would you advise I learn? I'm a quick learner, and I learn even better by -doing-, so these projects will help me get back into it a lot if someone can just... point me in the right direction, I guess you'd say. I'm feeling very overwhelmed by the sheer amount of options you have for scripting and coding front and back end information on pages now, to the point that I'm not even sure what the limitations are anymore.<br /><br />If someone could take a moment of their time to be my personal "w3school counselor", I would be in your debt.<br /><br />Thank you everyone.<br /><BR>

I stumbled along a website using some of these odd features and my head almost exploded.<br /><br /><a href="../css3.bradshawenterprises.com/default.htm" target="_blank">http://css3.bradshawenterprises.com/ </a> &lt;-- Chrome seems to be the most ahead browser in terms of CSS3, so use it.<br /><br />What are you're views on CSS3 and where it's heading?<BR>
