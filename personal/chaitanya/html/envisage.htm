	and oversaw several major technological programmes. He served on the Board of Directors of
	Hindustan Aeronautics Limited for several years. As a member of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s
	Scientific Advisory Council he was instrumental in establishing a major parallel computing 
	initiative in the country. He was the President of the Indian Academy of Sciences during 1992
