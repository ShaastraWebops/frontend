<span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Round 1</strong><span style="font-family:droid sans,sans-serif">:&nbsp;A detailed report on the functional aspects of your design should be sent to us. This should contain pictures, mechanisms, animations, etc. explaining your prototype.&nbsp;About 10 teams will be selected for the second round.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Round 2</strong><span style="font-family:droid sans,sans-serif">:&nbsp;The finalists will be asked to prepare 3-D CAD models of their design in any 3-D modelling software (Autodesk Inventor, Pro/Engineer, SolidWorks, CATIA, etc). The teams are expected to perform stress analysis and dynamic simulation of the models created, which will test the robustness of their design. They will also have to give a 5-10 minute presentation explaining details of their design and its features to the jury. A soft copy of the models have to be brought to the final round.</span></span></p>
