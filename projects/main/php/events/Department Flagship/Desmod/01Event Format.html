This should contain pictures, mechanisms, animations, etc. explaining your prototype.&nbsp;About 10 teams will be selected for the second round.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><u><strong>Round 2</strong></u>:&nbsp;The finalists will be asked to prepare 3-D CAD models of their design in any 3-D modelling software (Autodesk Inventor, Pro/Engineer, SolidWorks, CATIA, etc). The teams are expected to perform stress analysis and dynamic simulation of the models created, which will test the robustness of their design. They will also have to give a 5-10 minute presentation explaining details of their design and its features to the jury. A soft copy of the models have to be brought to the final round.</span></span></p>
