<p><span style="font-family:droid sans,sans-serif">There are Design geniuses whose products are awaited by the whole world. Be it a smartphone or a sports car, DESIGN is THE thing that matters. So are you the design genius the world deserves but hasn&#39;t got a chance till now ? Well, here&#39;s the opportunity you are looking for.</span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-family:droid sans,sans-serif">Unleash your engineering skills, creativity and intuition, and structure your ideas&nbsp;into a well-defined 3D model for the design problems. The challenge is to design a product keeping in mind its form and function, aesthetics and ergonomics with no compromise on its user friendliness. May the best design win !!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Pre-registered event</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:droid sans,sans-serif">The participants have to choose any ONE of the problem statement to work on. This consists of two rounds.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Round 1</strong></span><span style="font-family:droid sans,sans-serif">: <span style="font-size:14px">A detailed report on the functional aspects of your design should be sent to us. This should contain pictures, mechanisms, animations, etc. explaining your prototype.&nbsp;About 10 teams will be selected for the second round.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><br />
<span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Round 2</strong></span><span style="font-family:droid sans,sans-serif">: <span style="font-size:14px">The finalists will be asked to prepare 3-D CAD models of their design in any 3-D modelling software (Autodesk Inventor, Pro/Engineer, SolidWorks, CATIA, etc). The teams are expected to perform stress analysis and dynamic simulation of the models created, which will test the robustness of their design. They will also have to give a 5-10 minute presentation explaining details of their design and its features to the jury. A soft copy of the models have to be brought to the final round.</span></span></p>

&nbsp;</p>

<ul style="margin-left:25px; margin-right:0px">
	<li><span style="font-size:14px">Only one entry per team is allowed.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:14px">Maximum of 4 members are allowed in a team.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:14px">Any accepted CAD software can be used. Eg: Solid works, Catia, ProE, Autodesk inventor, etc. For detailed analysis, software such as Ansys, Fluent, MSC Adams, etc. can also be used if necessary.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:14px">Participants have to upload their Team Description Papers (TDP) for the preliminary round in the shaastra website.The selection for the finals would be based on this.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:14px">The designs can be altered for the finals but change of problem statement will not be entertained.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:14px">The participants are expected to perform dynamic simulation. (stress analysis, flow/thermal analysis, mechanical simulation if any) They would carry value points.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:14px">Participants are requested to include all features of their design in the Team description Paper (TDP) and if possible an animation of their mechanism.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:14px">PLAGIARISM, in any way, is strictly prohibited.</span></li>
</ul>
