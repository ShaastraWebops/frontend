<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px">Junkyard wars is vintage Shaastra. It tests your theoretical knowledge and how effectively you can use it to build and give life to practical working models using only junk. Contestants compete with pure mental prowess and ingenuity, in a raucous, fast-paced, head-to-head contest. Racing against the clock, teams scrap together working machines, with just a heap of junk at their disposal.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:14px">All we are looking for is loads of enthusiasm, a never give up attitude and a willingness to get your hands a little dirty. A general knowledge about how things work and perhaps a little bit of hands-on experience can prove to handy as well.<br />
In this event you start from the scrap and then let your imagination take it from there. Get a flavor of classic Shaastra and a chance to call out the engineer in you.</span></span></p>
