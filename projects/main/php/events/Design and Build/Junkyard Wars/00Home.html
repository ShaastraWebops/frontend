<p style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:18px">Are you ready to get your hands dirty and create magic out of junk? </span></p>

<p style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:18px">Here comes Junkyard Wars, a battle where the team having the best innovative minds and can churn out anything from plain old scrap emerge victorious. This ultimate hands on event of Shaastra is also the most popular among the masses.&nbsp;Once up in the battlefield, the contestants see themselves in a neck to neck, adrenaline rushed, race against the time competition.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:18px">In this best platform for showcasing your engineering skills, a little knowledge about how things work and hands on experience come handy.&nbsp; What we need are eyes which look at junk as treasure and loads of enthusiasm to create wonders with this treasure. Remember the Atom in real steel, a junkyard bot&nbsp;emerged as a people&rsquo;s champion. &nbsp;So, gear up for the event &nbsp;and bring out the engineer in you.</span></p>
