He is not a scientist, he is not a mathematician, he is not a sociologist or a writer; but he may use the knowledge and techniques of any or all of these disciplines in solving engineering problems.&quot;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gone are the days when Jack of all Trades can be a master of none. Engineering today has become all pervasive and the boundaries between multiple streams of engineering have dwindled significantly. An omniscient engineer is one who everyone is on the lookout for in today&rsquo;s competitive world.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;THE ULTIMATE ENGINEER&rdquo;, one of the few multidisciplinary events in Shaastra, examines the expertise of all hard-core engineers as they have to prove their mettle in more than one stream of engineering, both theoretically and hands-on as they will be confronted with problems engulfing multiple streams of engineering. Be it about fixing incomprehensible bugs or meddling with circuits or in innovating with mechanisms, an engineering spectacle is about to unfold in this Shaastra as the participants pit their wits against the best in the business to be crowned &ldquo;THE ULTIMATE ENGINEER&rdquo;.</span></span></p>
