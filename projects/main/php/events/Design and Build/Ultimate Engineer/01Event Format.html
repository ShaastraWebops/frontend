<p><strong><span style="font-size:18px">Problem Statement and TDP template to be released soon !</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Round-1: Prelims:</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Written round with on the spot registration.</span></p>

<ul style="margin-left:25px; margin-right:0px">
	<li>
	<p>Teams of at most 4 members (<strong>preferably from different departments)</strong>&nbsp;will be permitted to take the written test used to screen participants to the next round.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The written test, spanning about 75-90 minutes, will test the participants on their understanding of the most fundamental science and engineering concepts pertaining to all the branches, complimented by their quantitative and reasoning abilities.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The top 20 teams (<strong>subject to change</strong>) from the prelims will be selected for the second round.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The questions will be of both objective and descriptive types</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The test does not test any core engineering concepts. Courses done in high school and the 1st year of engineering will more than suffice for the participants to take up the test.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Round-2:</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>A hands-on cum written round</strong></span></p>

<ul style="margin-left:25px; margin-right:0px">
	<li>
	<p>Shortlisted teams from the first round will be invited to a more engrossing engineering battle in the second round. This round comprises two groups each consisting of 3-5 broader engineering themes among which the teams need to choose one in each group and accomplish the problem statements pertaining to the themes they have chosen within the prescribed time limit.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The event tests both the analytical and creative ability of the students as well as their levels of application of engineering concepts to solve real life problems.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>All the requisite materials and other resources for brainstorming will be provided to the participants during the conduct of the event.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Round- 3: Climb the engineering summit:</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Development of Products and Engineering Solutions</strong></span></p>

<p>The top 8 teams (subject to change) from the 2<span style="font-size:11px">nd</span>&nbsp;round will be selected for the grand finale which involves competent product and solutions development to pragmatic engineering problems. This demands hardcore application and integration of engineering concepts spanning across diverse boundaries in order to develop a complete product from scratch and demonstrate them in front of a team of experts who will evaluate them based on their simplicity and utility.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Note: All the requisite materials and other resources for brainstorming will be provided to the participants during the conduct of the event.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Awards and Prize Money</strong></span></p>

<p>Loads of cash prizes and goodies are up for grabs and above all the pride of being crowned the &ldquo;Ultimate Engineer&rdquo; in the biggest engineering extravaganza in the country is at stake.</p>
