<em>Disclaimer</em> : CFI and&nbsp;Shaatsra are&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;acting as an incubator here, but merely preparing startup worthy ideas for incubation by funding them and providing office space. We are giving a startup like environment, but the teams can register themselves as companies after they incubate themselves after this course.</p>
