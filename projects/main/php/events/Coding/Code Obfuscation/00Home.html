<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size:26px">Introduction</span></strong></p>

<p>Have you ever prided yourself in coming up with the most bizarre solutions to simple problems? Do you enjoy experimenting with your code, toying with unusual semantics? Come this Shaastra and experience all that and more at Code Obfuscation.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Obfuscate Code is source or machine code that has been made difficult to understand for humans. After participating in this contest you might get the idea that every language feature makes code unsustainable - not so, this can happen only if properly &lsquo;misused&rsquo;. Then probably you become a good coder. The aim of this competition is:<br />
<br />
- To make you write the most obscure/obfuscated C program within the rules given.<br />
- To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way.<br />
- To stress C compilers with unusual code.<br />
- To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language.<br />
- To provide a safe forum for poor C code.</p>
