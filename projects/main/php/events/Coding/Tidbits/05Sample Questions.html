<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="background-color:transparent; font-family:arial">Bob and Alice want to exchange highly confidential mails between each other. They know that the postwoman Eve is dishonest and opens the mails. Each of them has their own key and matching lock, and Alice has a wooden box she plans on locking. Neither key can be used on the other lock. Using the box, how can the two successfully exchange mails without the postwoman Eve-sdropping? Pun intended.</span></span></p>
