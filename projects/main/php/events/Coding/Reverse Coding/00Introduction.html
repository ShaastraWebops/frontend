<p>Reverse Coding is an event which tests logical thinking and basic programming skills. The idea behind this event is to figure out the &quot;Black Box&quot;. In other words the&nbsp;participants are&nbsp;given an executable program and are asked to do reverse coding, that is to develop&nbsp;the source code. The event will test your basic logic skills along with pattern analysis and recognition as you play with the&nbsp;code, identify the patterns and decipher it.</p>
