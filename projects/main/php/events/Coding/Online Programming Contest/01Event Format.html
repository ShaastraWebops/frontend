<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The event will be on an online judging platform - For all those who are not aware of this environment - Solution to every problem should be uploaded to the online judge.<br />
The judge will run the code against a set of test cases which is not available to the contestant.<br />
If the code returns the expected output to those test cases within the specified time limit, the code is judged to be accepted. In case, of wrong answer a &quot;wrong answer&quot; message is displayed. In case, the code doesn&#39;t return the output within the expected time limit, a &quot;Time limit exceeded&quot; message will be displayed. In case the code uses more memory than that is specified, a &quot;Run Time error&quot; message will be displayed. If the code doesn&#39;t compile properly for the specified language a &quot;Compile Error&quot; message will be displayed.<br />
The points to every problem is calculated based on the time taken to solve that problem from the beginning of the contest with an additional 20 minutes penalty to every submission which is not accepted. Note that the penalty will be added only when a particular problem is solved.<br />
The teams are ranked in the increasing order of the time taken.<br />
For questions where special rules apply, it will be clearly mentioned in the problem statement.</p>
