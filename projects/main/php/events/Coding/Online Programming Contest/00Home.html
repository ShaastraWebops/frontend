<p><span style="font-family:droid sans,sans-serif">Do you think using arrays are too naive to get the minimum element from a set of numbers?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:droid sans,sans-serif">Then you are in the right event.&nbsp;OPC is one of the biggest programming contests held in the country. With a right mix of mathematics, algorithms, data structures and programming this contest has something to offer for everyone.</span></p>
