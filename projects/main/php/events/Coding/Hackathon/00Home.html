<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">And that&#39;s not all-selected participants would be offered an internship with The Hindu&#39;s digital team, where they can see their prototype taken live and applied in a real-world situation!<br />
