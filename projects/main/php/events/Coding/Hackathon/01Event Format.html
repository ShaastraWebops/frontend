<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Problem Statement is very generic. You will be given a real world domain in which you&nbsp;<br />
have to prepare a working prototype which has some real world application and related to the&nbsp;<br />
given domain.</span></span></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&nbsp; &nbsp; For example the domain can be like E-Commerce and you can design prototypes such as&nbsp;<br />
Payment gateway or&nbsp;Fraud detector or any other things which relate to the given area.</span></span></p>
