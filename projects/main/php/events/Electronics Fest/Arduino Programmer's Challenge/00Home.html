<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:arial">Arduino is a very common electronics&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:arial">prototyping platform. Arduino coding is so easy to learn that somebody with decent experience with C or C++ can pick it up within an hour. There are coding challenges for C and python so why don&rsquo;t we have one such competition for Arduino. In this challenge, the participant will be asked to solve a logical hands-on puzzle with the Arduino or write a cryptic code for the Arduino.</span></span></p>
