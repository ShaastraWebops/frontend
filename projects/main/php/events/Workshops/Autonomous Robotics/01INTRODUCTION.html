<p><span style="background-color:transparent; font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:18px">Have you ever wondered how robots are made, how sophisticated sensors are used to automate a robot? </span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:18px">Ever dreamt of making an intelligent robot that can perform a task on its own?</span><span style="background-color:transparent; font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:18px"> If you have, and if you want to know how it&rsquo;s done, Autonomous Robotics Workshop at Shaastra is the place to be for you. Shaastra gives you an opportunity to take a glimpse at the wonderful world of Autonomous Robotics.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The workshop takes you through the world of microcontrollers and ICs. Get to know how to program a microcontroller and scratch your head to develop algorithms for your very own autonomous robot. Put on your programmers cap and be ready to learn how to code your robot to follow a line with the help of simple infrared sensors.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">A single day workshop, in its best form, will inspire you. What happens when you actually start working on technology and you face problems? When you face problems, your motivation goes down and then comes a low-point when most people quit. This Shaastra, we go a step further in ensuring your sustained growth.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Master the art of debugging your robot and isolating the flaws in your code, circuit or mechanisms. Learn the technique to reverse engineer the solution to your problem.&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="background-color:transparent">Be there for the Autonomous Robotics Workshop!</span></span></span></p>
