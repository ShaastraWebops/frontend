<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="color:#FFFFFF"><span style="font-family:droid sans,sans-serif">As champions of prestigious robotics competitions such as International Aerial Robotics Competition 2010, DRDO 2010, DRDO 2011, Robocon India 2009, IIT Madras has a rich tradition of excellence in robotics. IIT Madras went in as the favourites for Robocon India 2013 and achieved the prestigious &lsquo;Fastest job solving robot&rsquo; award.&nbsp; Teams at IIT Madras work round the year on projects and competitions, some of which push the frontiers of technology. In line with the same tradition, Shaastra becomes the battleground for teams all over the country to establish their supremacy in robotics.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family:droid sans,sans-serif">Ever dreamt of making an intelligent robot that can perform a task on its own? This Shaastra gives you an opportunity to propel yourself into the world of robotics with the Autonomous robotics workshop designed to give you an edge and inspire you to delve deeper.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="color:#FFFFFF"><span style="font-family:droid sans,sans-serif">The workshop takes you through the world of microcontrollers and ICs. Get to know how to program a microcontroller and scratch your head to develop algorithms for your very own autonomous bot. Put on your programmers cap and be ready to learn how to code your robot to follow a line with the help of simple infrared sensors.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family:droid sans,sans-serif">But, a single day workshop in its best form will inspire you. What happens when you actually start working on technology and you face problems? When you face problems, your motivation goes down and then comes a low-point when most people quit. This Shaastra, we go a step further in ensuring your sustained growth.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="color:#FFFFFF"><span style="font-family:droid sans,sans-serif">Master the art of debugging your robot and isolating the flaws in your code, circuit or mechanisms. Learn the technique to reverse engineer the solution to your problem.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family:droid sans,sans-serif">So this Shaastra, let your robotic skills flow, be ready to fulfil your tech-dreams, be ready to be amazed, be ready to learn, be ready for Shaastra Robotics workshop.</span></span></span></p>
