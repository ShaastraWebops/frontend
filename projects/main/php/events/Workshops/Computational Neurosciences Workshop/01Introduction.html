<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:20px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">At present there seems nothing more exciting than to know how the human brain works. Brain is the most complex, sophisticated, and powerful information-processing device known. Computational neuroscience is a multidisciplinary endeavour pooling together methods from computer science, mathematics and physics to complement experimental research in neuroscience, and to address the analysis of complex data sets generated by the brain</span></span>.</p>
