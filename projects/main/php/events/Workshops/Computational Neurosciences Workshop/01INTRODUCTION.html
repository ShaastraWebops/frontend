<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">At present there seems nothing more exciting than to know how the brain works. Brain is the most complex, sophisticated, and powerful information-processing device known. Computational neuroscience is a multidisciplinary endeavour pooling together methods from computer science, mathematics and physics to complement experimental research in neuroscience, and to address the analysis of complex data sets generated by the brain.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">This workshop provides an introduction to basic computational methods for understanding what a nervous system does and for determining how it functions. You will explore the computational principles governing various aspects of vision and sensory motor control using MATLAB, &nbsp;the most commonly used data analysis and visualization tool for quantitative sciences.</span></span></p>
