<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:droid sans,sans-serif">Hovercraft , the most popular &nbsp;class of &nbsp;<strong>ACVs (Air Cushion Vehicles)</strong> , is one of&nbsp;the few ACVs that generate lift independent of thrust, as the name suggests, it hovers.Once challenged widely and noted with skepticism for its bold design, it was claimed to be&nbsp;just another outlandish model on paper, yet another flying car, with no practical application.&nbsp;Today , beating all odds, hovercraft is being used in a lot of rescue military operations.</span></span></p>
