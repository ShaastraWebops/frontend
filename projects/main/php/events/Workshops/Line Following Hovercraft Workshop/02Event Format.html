<p><span style="font-size:18px">The workshop will begin with a small introduction about the hovercraft and its working principles, and basic electronics. By the end of the workshop, the participant teams will have built a line following Hovercraft which they can take home! Not just that,&nbsp;the participants will also be taught how to convert it into a RC (Remote Controlled) one. The most striking point, however, that the participants will notice is the application of simple science to make cool stuff work!</span></p>
