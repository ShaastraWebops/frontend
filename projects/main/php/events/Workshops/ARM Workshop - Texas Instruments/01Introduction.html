<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:18px">The one day hands-on workshop covers the architecture of ARM Cortex M4 Microcontroller from&nbsp;Texas Instruments, data, program memory, peripheral organization and its special features. The&nbsp;peripherals include I/O Ports, Timers, PWM, A/D Converters, Universal Serial Interfaces and&nbsp;Comparators. The course is structured and tailored to meet the need of the engineering students to&nbsp;get a very good exposure of ARM Cortex M4 Controllers which can be very well extrapolated to any&nbsp;other platform. Typical applications could be battery powered sensor signal acquisition, processing&nbsp;and serial transmission to a host system.</span></span></p>
