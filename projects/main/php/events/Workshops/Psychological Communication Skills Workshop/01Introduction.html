<p><span style="font-size:16px">In general when one person&nbsp;expresses himself, and the second&nbsp;person understands him, a communication between the two of them&nbsp;is established. But what if that person is not even willing to listen to you? What if you find it difficult to reason with them? What if a &quot;talk&quot; on an issue turns into a &quot;debate&quot; everytime? The&nbsp;solutions to these problems are&nbsp;contained in understanding the psychology of communication.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px">If you want to improve your communication skills and develop a confident exterior, do turn up for the Psychological Communication Skills Workshop and let your hidden creativty flow!</span></p>
