<p>This time in Shaastra we are having Product Design Workshop,&nbsp;in which you will learn how to &nbsp;convert&nbsp;your dream product in real model. With the use of CNC machine learn how you can replicate a 3D model made in various softwares like SolidWorks, Autodesk Inventor etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;into a real structure. We will also guide you about various parameters that you need to know, while working with CNC machine like :</p>

<ul>
	<li>Tool Size</li>
	<li>Tool RMP (Cutting Speed)</li>
	<li>Feedrate etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, join us to know the best way to prototype your dream project, using CNC machine and understand the minutes of 3D modeling and prototyping.</p>
