<p><span style="font-size:18px">Code Fu hustle, a modified code-retreat, is a half day- intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development methodology and design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of &#39;getting things done&#39;, the code retreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Practicing the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time.</span></p>
