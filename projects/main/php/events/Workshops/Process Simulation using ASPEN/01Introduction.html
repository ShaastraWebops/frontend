It is widely used process simulator in various chemical, petrochemical, petroleum refining, polymer and coal based plants. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="background-color:transparent">Programming software can be used for solve model structures of chemical process with a small number of equations. However, as the complexity of the model structure increases by the addition of several processes, solving large set of equations becomes challenge. ASPEN plus comes handy while dealing with these situations. </span></span></span></p>
