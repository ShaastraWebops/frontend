<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">We all love playing those motion-sensitive games Asphalt and NFS on our smartphones, don&rsquo;t we? What would it take to build a robot that would, just as your favourite car in NFS, be motion sensitive? Presenting to you Wireless Motion-Controlled Robotics Workshop.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">This is an advanced Robotics workshop at the end of which you would be able to build a motion-controlled mobile robot which can be controlled wirelessly. This will take you through the basics of Wireless Communication, Microcontrollers, Electronics and Robotics.</span></span></p>
