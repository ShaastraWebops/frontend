<strong>About the speaker:</strong></p>

<p>Arnab Rai Choudhuri is a Professor of Physics at the Indian Institute of Science. He received his PhD in 1985 from the University of Chicago under the supervision of Eugene Parker, usually regarded as the most influential solar physicist of our time. Choudhuri has carried on theoretical research on the formation of sunspots and the 11-year sunspot cycle. He was one of the originators of the flux transport dynamo model, the currently favoured theoretical model of the 11-year sunspot cycle. He is the author of two advanced textbooks, &quot;The Physics of Fluids and Plasmas&quot; (Cambridge University Press, 1998) and &quot;Astrophysics for Physicists&quot; (Cambridge<br />
University Press, 2010), used in many universities around the world.<br />
His first popular science book &quot;Nature&#39;s Third Cycle: A Story of Sunspots&quot; will be published by Oxford University Press soon.&nbsp; Choudhuri is a Fellow<br />
of Indian Academy of Sciences and Indian National Science Academy.</p>
