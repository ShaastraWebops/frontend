<span style="color:#FFFFFF"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:droid sans,sans-serif">Ever dreamt of making your own remote-controlled car that dances to your will? This year, Shaastra gives you an opportunity to propel yourself into the world of robotics with a Manual Robosoccer workshop designed to give you an edge and inspire you to delve deeper.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="color:#FFFFFF"><span style="font-family:droid sans,sans-serif">This workshop helps you learn the basics of robotics, mechanisms and components and then build your first remote-controlled robot. Learn about the principle of differential drive, build a robot from scratch using a metal chassis, two motor powered wheels, connect the neural network of the robot by wiring the motors to the remote control and the battery and make the robot go forward, backward or turn on the spot.</span></span></span></p>

<span style="font-size:18px"><span style="color:#FFFFFF"><span style="font-family:droid sans,sans-serif">Prerequisites?</span><br />
<span style="font-family:droid sans,sans-serif">None, just enough enthusiasm and you are good to fly. Rest assured that you will get enough hands on experience, so as to build various advanced clamping, throwing and rotating mechanisms using gears-structures, linkages, rack and pinion etc., limited only by your imagination. This workshop will prove to be the basic pillar for your voyage into the world of robotics.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="color:#FFFFFF"><span style="font-family:droid sans,sans-serif">So this Shaastra, let your robotic skills flow, be ready to fulfill your tech-dreams, be ready to be amazed, be ready to learn, be ready for Shaastra Robosoccer workshop.</span></span></span></p>
