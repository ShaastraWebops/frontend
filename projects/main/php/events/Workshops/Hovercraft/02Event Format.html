<p><span style="font-size:18px">The workshop will begin with a small introduction about the hovercraft and its working principles with basics on electronics. Every team will be provided with the materials required(Kit) for building the hovercraft along with a manual for guidance. Our team will be there with you always to help you build the perfect hovercraft. In the meantime, we will help you gain clarity about the design of the hovercraft and the components used in building it. By the end of the workshop, participating teams will have an RC(Remote Controlled) Hovercraft which they can take home! But most importantly, participants will witness how application of simple science can make things work.</span></p>
