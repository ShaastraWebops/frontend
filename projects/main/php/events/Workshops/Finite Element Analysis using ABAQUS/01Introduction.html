<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:18px">Finite element analysis (FEA) is a numerical method, traditionally developed for Solid Mechanics, but now finds common application in&nbsp;multi-physics problems. It provides the closest approximate solution to the most complicated problems which cannot be solved otherwise for an exact solution.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:18px">FEA&nbsp;finds it application in all categories of problems, ranging from structural analysis, solid mechanics, and dynamics to thermal analysis, electrical analysis and even in bio-materials.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:18px">Invent of powerful computers has given a boost to FEA&nbsp;study. Majority of engineering analysis software use FEA&nbsp;techniques in order to solve complicated problems.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:18px">ABAQUS is one of the most widely used finite element analysis (FEA) tool, used mainly in mechanical, civil and aerospace engineering industries. ABAQUA is known for its high performance, quality and ability to solve engineering simulations.</span></span></p>
