<span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:18px">Shaastra Junior Quiz is&nbsp;one of the most popular events at Shaastra. This year we aim to make it even bigger and more wide-spread, by conducting it in all major cities in India. The finalists will battle it out in the grand finale at IIT-M during Shaastra to win several goodies and cash prizes, along with the honour of claiming the title of Shaastra Junior Quiz champions.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:18px">This quiz requires more quick thinking and basic general knowledge than an extensive encyclopedic memory. Most&nbsp;of the questions can be worked out from the clues in them, and promise to be interesting and approachable. With this quiz, we aim to improve the interest in, and the level of,&nbsp;quizzes at school&nbsp;level. We also hope to continue improving&nbsp;further after the success of the previous editions.</span></span><br />
