<blockquote>
<p>Design is not what it feels or looks like, Design is how it works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For all those who believe in this, Wright Design returns once again to cater to the engineer&nbsp;in you.</p>

<p>Wright design is a design and build event which gives you the opportunity to bring out the best of the aero modeler in you. The only way to find the limits of the possible is by going beyond the impossible and Breaking The Boundaries. With an all new challenging problem statement this year, what can you do when your good isn&#39;t good enough?</p>

<p>Do you have the ability to take up the challenge, realize your dream and emerge&nbsp;as a winner??</p>

<p>Think, design and build. Compete at Shaastra 2015&nbsp;to prove your mettle!</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong><span style="font-size:26px">Event Format</span></strong></p>

<p><u><strong><span style="font-size:18px">Round 1</span></strong></u> - Submission of TDP</p>

<ul>
	<li>Every team is required to produce a write-up describing the basic idea employed in designing and building the glider.</li>
	<li>In Team Description paper (TDP) the teams have to answer a subjective questionnaire related to your design of the glider.</li>
	<li>It will have general questions related to roll, pitch, yaw etc. and how the participants plan to maximise the payload carried by their aircraft.</li>
	<li>Some approximate aircraft parameters must be mentioned.</li>
	<li><strong>Note -&nbsp;</strong>Originality in the design will be the basis for selection of teams for the event. Submission must be in the format we mention.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong><span style="font-size:18px">Round 2</span></strong></u> - Presentation Round</p>

<ul>
	<li>Shortlisted teams from the first round will be invited to IIT Madras during Shaastra 2015 (3<sup>rd</sup>-6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;January).</li>
	<li>Every team must give a power point presentation (ppt) before a panel of judges.</li>
	<li>The presentation should incorporate the idea, aircraft parameters and uniqueness of the design.</li>
	<li>The presentation must also explain how exactly you arrived at the design, and the design parameters chosen. In a nutshell your presentations must be informative and prove your worthiness.</li>
	<li>The final points for this part will be given only after a keen assessment of the design by the judges. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>A PowerPoint presentation template will be available on the website soon.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong><span style="font-size:18px">Round 3</span></strong></u> -&nbsp;Flight Testing Round</p>

<ul>
	<li>The glider shall be launched by using variable angle slingshot mechanism launcher (see Problem Statement) provided by coordinators.</li>
	<li>The glider should consist of features mentioned during the presentation round.&nbsp;Failing to do so will have the teams&nbsp;penalised.</li>
	<li>Teams should note that the place where flight testing is done is an open area; hence changes in wind direction may occur. Teams should keep this in mind while designing the glider.</li>
</ul>
