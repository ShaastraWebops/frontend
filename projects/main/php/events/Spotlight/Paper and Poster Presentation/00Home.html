<p><span style="font-size:18px">Although bricks are the building blocks of a house, a house is not merely made of bricks. Without the proper foundation and the &ldquo;cement&rdquo; to bind the bricks together, the house will collapse. Similar is the case with Science.</span></p>
&nbsp;

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Science comprises of facts and hard evidences. With solely the knowledge of facts, and no connections between them, the facts are quite ineffective. It is after connecting the dots, stringing the facts, gluing together the pieces that science begins to take place. This is where reason comes in. It is through research that one can reason out and put together the puzzled pieces. The true goal of all scientific research is to contribute to the consensus of universally accepted knowledge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">This year at<strong>&nbsp;Shaastra 2015</strong>, we invite you all to come and communicate your findings and make them practicable, because we strongly believe that all genuine scientific procedures of thought and argument are essentially the same as those of everyday life.</span></p>
