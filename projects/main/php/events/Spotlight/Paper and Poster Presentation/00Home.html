<p><span style="font-size:18px"><em>Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge</em>.&rdquo; &ndash; Carl Sagan</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Anything created isn&#39;t all about what it is made of. Without the thought that goes into the making and the basics, its nothing at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
&nbsp;

<p><span style="font-size:18px">Science comprises of facts and hard evidences. With solely the knowledge of facts, and no connections between them, the facts are quite ineffective. It is after connecting the dots, stringing the facts, gluing together the pieces that science begins to take place. This is where reason comes in. It is through research that one can reason out and put together the puzzled pieces. The true goal of all scientific research is to contribute to the consensus of universally accepted knowledge.</span></p>

Ideas have existence beyond time&quot;.</em></span></p>
