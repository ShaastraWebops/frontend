<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:lucida sans unicode,lucida grande,sans-serif">The IIT Madras International Symposium is a platform for bright minds across the world to meet and engage in intimate discussion and debate on emerging global challenges. It is held in association with Shaastra, IIT Madras&#39; annual technical festival - <a href="http://shaastra.org/">SHAASTRA</a>&nbsp;in the first week on January, 2015.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:lucida sans unicode,lucida grande,sans-serif">The theme for this year&#39;s symposium is &quot;Healthcare&quot;. Under this broad umbrella topic, we would be discussing the influence technology and big data have on healthcare, the policy changes India would need to implement in order to improve the healthcare scenario and the large widening disparity that exists in the healthcare industry today.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:lucida sans unicode,lucida grande,sans-serif">Participants of the IITM International Symposium would meet some of the biggest names in these three tracks from all around the world. In addition to the huge cultural exchange between the international and Indian students and the tremendous learning curve made possible due to a diverse set of participants, the IITM Symposium promises to be a great experience for all!&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:lucida sans unicode,lucida grande,sans-serif"><span style="background-color:transparent">India is caught in a flux between unbelievable growth on one hand, and widening inequalities on the other. To navigate this wide spectrum of people, and to form inclusive policies such that it caters to every member of a very diverse society, as the world&rsquo;s largest democracy must, remains a challenge to the government, and providers of care. Following a decade of rapid growth fuelled by a prosperous service sector (which has led to an equally flourishing urban culture of health consumerism), indicators of health are still poor, healthcare infrastructure insufficient and plagued by inefficiency, and personal expenditure on health, which many can ill-afford, continues to be high. Over the four days of the Symposium, the participants will be addressed by mentors from the fields of technology, policy and the social sciences, and will debate positions to improve present conditions. The discussions will involve questions exploring concepts like equality and democracy, the role of the state, and the <a href="#" id="_GPLITA_0" in_rurl="http://i.display-trk.com/click?v=SU46Njg3NzA6MTM1MTptYXJrZXQ6ZjIyZTM3NDE0ZjFmYTkxMGUzYjFlOGYyNTE2YTNhODI6ei0wLTA6d3d3LnNoYWFzdHJhLm9yZzoyMDY3NzA6NmU3MzYyZTQ0MzQ1YTgxNzQxYTYyYjU1Yzk2NzA3NmE6ZWRmMDdjZWVlZWQ3NGYyNTg0ZDQwNmFiZjRmOWZiOTk6MA&amp;subid=g-0-52e077b4f13343fab1ba9665f69e4dda-&amp;data_tagname=SPAN" style="border: none !important; display: inline-block !important; text-indent: 0px !important; float: none !important; font-weight: bold !important; height: auto !important; margin: 0px !important; min-height: 0px !important; min-width: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; text-transform: uppercase !important; text-decoration: underline !important; vertical-align: baseline !important; width: auto !important; background: transparent !important;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Solid Savings">market<img src="http://solidsaving-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png" style="background:transparent !important; border:none !important; display:inline-block !important; float:none !important; font-weight:bold !important; height:10px !important; margin:0px 0px 0px 3px !important; min-height:0px !important; min-width:0px !important; padding:0px !important; text-decoration:underline !important; text-indent:0px !important; text-transform:uppercase !important; vertical-align:super !important; width:10px !important" /></a>&nbsp;in healthcare.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:lucida sans unicode,lucida grande,sans-serif"><span style="background-color:transparent">The Indian medical technology industry is expected to grow from US$2.7 billion in 2008 to US$14 billion in 2020. Although this is an age of remarkable advances in healthcare, this has not resulted into its transformation into an inclusive and accessible provision. Most health facilities across the country face staggering infrastructure issues of the most basic sort.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:lucida sans unicode,lucida grande,sans-serif"><span style="background-color:transparent">Healthcare technology has undergone much change, but it is an expensive dream even today in many places in India. Under this category, topics such as the implications of big data, democratisation of healthcare through access to available new technologies and cost-effective, safe and affordable technological innovations which make healthcare inexpensive and available to everyone will be explored. Big data in healthcare is an area of tremendous potential, and has implications across several areas- in the prediction of diseases, comparison of symptoms and test results to form large databases, and even access to healthcare and monitoring services through social media and smartphone applications. Under this, risks involved with privacy, security and management will be discussed.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="background-color:transparent; font-family:lucida sans unicode,lucida grande,sans-serif">Such issues are of paramount importance in recent times.

Apart from the considerable infrastructure deficit (in medical colleges, doctors, staff and hospitals), about 85% of the country is not covered by an insurance scheme, and most have no access to even primary healthcare facilities, as it still remains a largely private-sector enterprise which only the wealthy can access. </span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:lucida sans unicode,lucida grande,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="background-color:transparent">Under policy, the students and mentors will also engage in discussions related to the emerging IPR debate on India&rsquo;s standards of patent flexibility. The legal aspects surrounding the health sector in India are of paramount importance as it has contributed to the development of the unique Indian pharmaceutical industry. The patent laws placing affordability at the centre rather than patent production was instrumental in a flourishing domestic industry. This has influenced the industry in other developing countries too. Recently however, this has suffered a setback, and India patent laws have been accused of violation of those of the WTO. IPR raises important questions of equal access and ownership of knowledge, and to what extent each can be justified.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:lucida sans unicode,lucida grande,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="background-color:transparent">As a country of great diversity, India encounters unique challenges in the implementation and execution of policy, and provision of care, because of several social factors which determine access to well-devised healthcare. These include an unequal distribution of wealth, the powerful forces caste and gender (which are all socio-economic factors), and also geography.&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style="font-family:lucida sans unicode,lucida grande,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="background-color:transparent">Furthermore, in these discussions, social and systemic structures that curtail access to healthcare, especially in the case of women and children, will be examined, and more pluralistic, inclusive approaches will be debated upon.</span></span></span></p>
