You have over a thousand slaves at your disposal and just under 24 hours to determine which bottle is poisoned. You have a handful of prisoners about to be executed, and it would mar your celebration to have anyone else killed. What is the smallest number of prisoners you&nbsp;must have to drink from the bottles to be absolutely sure to find the poisoned bottle within 24 hours?</span></p>
