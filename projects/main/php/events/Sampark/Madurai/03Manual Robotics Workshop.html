This year, Shaastra gives you an opportunity to propel yourself into the world of robotics with a Manual Robotics&nbsp;workshop designed to give you an edge and inspire you to delve deeper.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:40px"><span style="font-size:20px">This workshop helps you learn the basics of robotics, mechanisms and components and then build your first remote-controlled robot. Learn about the principle of differential drive, various clamping mechanisms&nbsp;and how to&nbsp;build a robot from scratch.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left:40px"><span style="font-size:20px">Prerequisites?<br />
None, just enough enthusiasm and you are good to go. Rest assured that you will get enough hands on experience, so as to build various advanced clamping&nbsp;mechanisms using gears-structures, linkages, rack and pinion etc., limited only by your imagination. This workshop will&nbsp;be the foundation for your voyage into the world of robotics.</span></p>
