<p style="margin-left:40px"><span style="font-size:20px">Science comprises of facts and hard evidences. With solely the knowledge of facts, and no connections between them, the facts are quite ineffective. It is after connecting the dots, stringing the facts, gluing together the pieces that science begins to take place. This is where reason comes in. It is through research that one can reason out and put together the puzzled pieces. The true goal of all scientific research is to contribute to the consensus of universally accepted knowledge.</span></p>
