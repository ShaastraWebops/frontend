<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif">Dr.Kakodkar has been a key contributor to India&rsquo;s strategic nuclear programme. He was among the chosen few involved in the first successful Peaceful Nuclear Explosion Experiment that India conducted on May 18, 1974 at Pokhran.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif">He played a key role in the series of successful Nuclear Tests conducted during May 1998, again at Pokhran. India also demonstrated nuclear submarine powerpack technology under Kakodkar&rsquo;s leadership.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif">He has published over 250 scientific papers and is a distinguished Padma Trio.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif">He became the Director of BARC in the year 1996 and was the Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission and Secretary to the Government of India, Department of Atomic Energy, during the years 2000 -2009.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif">Currently he is DAE Homi Bhabha Chair Professor at BARC. Dr. Kakodkar devotes his time primarily on issues related to energy, education and societal development. </span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif">Focus of his work has been on self-reliant development of nuclear reactor systems to address the Indian programme requirements. </span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif">He has created a roadmap for shaping the third stage of India&rsquo;s nuclear power programme aimed at tapping vast energy potential of our thorium resources not only as source for electricity production but also as a primary source for other forms of energy use.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif">Dr.Kakodkar continues to be actively involved in programmes related to augmentation of Thorium utilisation in our nuclear power programme. </span></span></p>
