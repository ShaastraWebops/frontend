		                            <b>What about the security facilities ?</b><br />
		                            IITM campus has a vigilant and round-the-clock security service. To ensure the safety of the participants, there will be additional security guards in hostels in order to avoid thefts and other mishaps. However, the Shaastra team will not take responsibility of any theft or other mishaps. Therefore, participants are requested to take care of their belongings.<br /><br />

		                            <b>What about certificates and prize money ?</b><br />
		                            For competitive events, certificates will be given only to the teams coming first, second and third. For major events all participants qualifying to the final round will be issued certificates. <br />
		                            Participation certificates will not be given. Instead, a general letter of participation will be given to the participants. For more information, visit the certificate policy tab in the Shaastra website. The cash prize amount is event-specific and details can be found out by visiting the events page on the Shaastra website.<br /><br />

		                            <b>One of our team members who had been provided accommodation is unable to come, so can we replace him with our other team member ?</b><br />
		                            First, kindly get approval for replacement of your old team member from the coordinator of the event in which your team member was supposed to participate. After consulting with the event coordinator we will inform you whether we will be able to accommodate your new team member. The new team member coming should have all the documents that the other member was supposed to have.<br /><br />

		                            <b>Are there ATMs inside the campus ?</b><br />
		                            There are SBI, ICICI and Canara Bank ATMs and an SBI branch inside the campus. <br /><br />

		                            <b>Is there any internal transport keeping in mind the huge area of the campus ?</b><br />

		                            <b>Will there be any kind of transportation facility from airport/railway station to IIT-M campus for participants ?</b><br />
