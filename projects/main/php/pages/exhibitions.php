Some highlight projects of CFI Open House include the ‘Quadrotor’ which helped the Police Department of Chennai in a crime site investigation and projects done in collaboration with Railways, Chennai Corporation which autonomously checks the alignment changes of the overhead lines. Projects at CFI have great impact on the daily lives as well. How often does one lose a key and remain clueless about what to do? Students at CFI have come up with an ‘Electronic Lock’ wherein a password stored in mobile phones can open locked doors. Projects of Team Sahaay like a Standing Wheel Chair and Prosthetic Arms have a tremendous social impact as well. Innovations of this sort have always been a trademark of CFI.</p>
