<p>Prof.Arnab Rai Choudhuri is an Indian scientist working in the area of Astrophysical MHD(Magnetohydrodynamics), specially in context of solar magnetic cycle.</p>
<p>His research expertise is the theoretical study of magnetohydrodynamic processes in astrophysics – primarily related to the Sun, lthough he has also worked on active galaxies, extragalactic jets, neutron stars and pulsars. He is one of the creators of the flux transport dynamo model, the currently favored theoretical model of the 11-year sunspot cycle, and applied this model to successfully predict the strength of the last sunspot cycle. His two books The Physics of Fluids and Plasmas (1998, Cambridge University Press) and Astrophysics for Physicists (2010, Cambridge University Press) are widely used as textbooks in many universities around the world. In his latest book ,Nature's Third Cycle, Prof. Arnab discusses the fascinating science behind the sunspot cycle, and gives an insider's perspective of this cutting-edge scientific research from one of the leaders of the field.</p>
<p>Prof.Choudhuri has played a key role for many years in running the Joint Astronomy Programme, one of the most important graduate programmes of astrophysics in India. He served as the Convener of this Programme during 2000-07. He was one of the main organizers of the first Asia-Pacific Solar Physics Meeting (2011) and edited its Proceedings.</p>
<p>He has been a member of the Founding Editorial Board of the journal Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics since its inception in 2009. He obtained his bachelor’s of science degree in 1978 from the Presidency College under the University of Calcutta, and M.Sc degree in physics from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. He did his PhD from the University of Chicago in 1985 working under the supervision of Professor E.N. Parker. For next two years till 1987 he did research at the High Altitude Observatory, Boulder, USA. In 1987 he joined the Physics Department of Indian Institute of Science (IISc) as lecturer and became professor there in 2002.</p>
