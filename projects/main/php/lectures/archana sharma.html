Archana Sharma is an Indian experimental physicist and a staff member of CERN - European Organization for Nuclear Research since 1987 and is presently working on the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) project in Geneva, Switzerland.Recently concluded Higgs-Boson particle tests at CERN grabbed widespread attention in the world. During her more than 20 years of work at CERN, Archana Sharma acted as a strong Indian connection with the activities of CERN. She travels to India on a frequent basis and has initiated an internship program for Indian students at CERN. </span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent; font-family:arial; font-size:16px">Her contribution in research and development effort has been at various levels over the years. The recent evidence of a new Higgs-like boson at the LHC ( Large Hadron Collider) experiments is the culmination of the work of a collaboration of a team of eminent scientists across the world of which Dr.Archana Sharma was a member. Her specialisation is in developing radiation hard detectors for sustained operation at LHC upgrades. She is also very active and enthusiastic in offering seminars and courses to encourage young students to widen their horizon of thinking in the field of physics. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="background-color:transparent; font-family:arial; font-size:16px">She did her B.Sc and M.Sc. (Master&#39;s in Nuclear Physics) from the Banaras Hindu University, India 1980-1982. She has a PhD in Physics from University of Delhi 1989, a D.Sc fromUniversity of Geneva 1996, and was awarded an Exec. MBA from International University in Geneva in 2001.</span></p>
