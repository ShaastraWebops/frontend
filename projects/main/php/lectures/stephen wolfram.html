<p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="" src="../../img/lectures/stephen wolfram.jpg" style="float:left; height:310px; margin:10px; width:451px" /><span style="font-size:20px"><strong>Stephen Wolfram</strong></span> <span style="font-size:16px">is the creator of Mathematica, the author of A New Kind of Science, the creator of&nbsp;Wolfram|Alpha, and the founder and CEO of Wolfram Research. Over the course of his career, he has&nbsp;been responsible for many discoveries, inventions and innovations in science, technology and business.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px">Born in London in 1959, Wolfram was educated at Eton, Oxford, and Caltech. He published his first&nbsp;scientific paper at the age of 15, and had received his PhD in theoretical physics from Caltech by the&nbsp;age of 20. Wolfram&#39;s early scientific work was mainly in high-energy physics, quantum field theory,&nbsp;and cosmology, and included several now-classic results. Having started to use computers in 1973,&nbsp;Wolfram rapidly became a leader in the emerging field of scientific computing, and in 1979 he began the&nbsp;construction of SMP&mdash;the first modern computer algebra system&mdash;which he released commercially in&nbsp;1981.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px">In recognition of his early work in physics and computing, Wolfram became in 1981 the youngest&nbsp;recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship. Wolfram&#39;s first key idea was to use computer experiments to&nbsp;study the behavior of simple computer programs known as cellular automata. And starting in 1982,&nbsp;this allowed him to make a series of startling discoveries about the origins of complexity. The papers&nbsp;Wolfram published quickly had a major impact, and laid the groundwork for the emerging field that&nbsp;Wolfram called &quot;complex systems research.&quot;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px">Through the mid-1980s, Wolfram continued his work on complexity, discovering a number of&nbsp;fundamental connections between computation and nature, and inventing such concepts as&nbsp;computational irreducibility. Wolfram&#39;s work led to a wide range of applications&mdash;and provided the&nbsp;main scientific foundations for such initiatives as complexity theory and artificial life. Following his&nbsp;scientific work on complex systems research, in 1986 Wolfram founded the first research center and&nbsp;the first journal in the field, Complex Systems. Then, after a highly successful career in academia&mdash;first&nbsp;at Caltech, then at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, and finally as Professor of Physics,&nbsp;Mathematics, and Computer Science at the University of Illinois&mdash;Wolfram launched Wolfram Research,&nbsp;Inc.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px">Wolfram began the development of Mathematica in late 1986. The first version of Mathematica was&nbsp;released on June 23, 1988, and was immediately hailed as a major advance in computing. In the years&nbsp;that followed, the popularity of Mathematica grew rapidly, and W</span>olfram Research became established&nbsp;as a world leader in the software industry, widely recognized for excellence in both technology&nbsp;and business. Currently at Version 9, Mathematica has become the standard software language&nbsp;and environment for scientific, technical, and algorithmic computation, and algorithmic software&nbsp;development.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After more than ten years of highly concentrated work, Wolfram finally described his achievements in&nbsp;his 1200-page book A New Kind of Science. Released on May 14, 2002, the book was widely acclaimed&nbsp;and immediately became a bestseller. Its publication has been seen as initiating a paradigm shift of&nbsp;historic importance in science, with new implications emerging every year.&nbsp;Wolfram has been president and CEO of Wolfram Research since its founding in 1987. In addition to his&nbsp;business leadership, Wolfram is deeply involved in the development of the company&#39;s technology, and&nbsp;personally oversees the functional design of the company&#39;s core products.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In recent years, Wolfram&#39;s penchant for innovation has been applied ever more widely. Building on&nbsp;the deep technology stacks associated with Mathematica and Wolfram|Alpha, the advances of A New&nbsp;Kind of Science, and the success of his business endeavors, Wolfram is now developing technology and&nbsp;products in several important new directions.&nbsp;In addition to his direct personal contributions, Wolfram also serves as an advisor and mentor in a&nbsp;variety of corporate, entrepreneurial and educational settings.</p>
